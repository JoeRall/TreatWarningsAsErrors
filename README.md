# Treat Warnings As Errors

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xi6w5hiocoo86c7c?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JoeRall/treatwarningsaserrors) 

#### The build is failed because this project currently has warnings :smile:

AppVeyor will treat warnings as errors and fail the build with the help of this PowerShell [script](https://gist.github.com/JoeRall/1d85f64be9da6c5fe27b).

Special thanks to [David](https://github.com/flcdrg) and [Josh](https://github.com/jquintus) for the code and inspiration.
